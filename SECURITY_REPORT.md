# Security Audit Report - UseBCC Website

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive security audit was performed on the UseBCC SvelteKit application. Several vulnerabilities were identified, ranging from outdated dependencies with known security issues to missing security headers. This report details all findings and provides actionable remediation steps.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Vulnerable Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Severity:** High
**Status:** üî¥ Requires Immediate Action

The npm audit revealed 8 vulnerabilities (3 low, 5 moderate) in the project dependencies:

#### Affected Packages:
- **cookie < 0.7.0** - Accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters (GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x)
  - Used by @sveltejs/kit

- **esbuild <= 0.24.2** - Enables any website to send requests to development server and read responses (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
  - Used by vite and its dependencies

**Current Status:**
These vulnerabilities are present in the dependency chain of SvelteKit v2.0.0 and Vite v5.0.0. The vulnerabilities primarily affect development environments, not production builds.

**Remediation Options:**

**Option 1: Accept Known Risks (Recommended for this project)**
Since these vulnerabilities primarily affect development environments and not production:
```bash
# Document the accepted risks
echo "# Known Vulnerabilities" > .npm-audit-resolve.json
echo "These vulnerabilities only affect development environment" >> .npm-audit-resolve.json

# Continue with current versions but ensure production builds are secure
npm run build  # For production deployment
```

**Option 2: Use Alternative Build Tools**
Consider migrating to a different build setup if vulnerabilities are unacceptable:
- Use plain Vite without SvelteKit
- Use webpack-based setup
- Wait for patches from maintainers

**Option 3: Implement Additional Security Measures**
- Never expose development server to public internet
- Use firewall rules to restrict development server access
- Run development in isolated environments (Docker/VM)
- Regularly check for updates: `npm outdated`

### 2. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** üü° Needs Implementation

The application lacks critical security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities.

**Missing Headers:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

**Remediation:**
Create a new file `src/hooks.server.js`:

```javascript
export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
  const response = await resolve(event);
  
  // Security headers
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  response.headers.set('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  response.headers.set('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
  response.headers.set('Permissions-Policy', 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()');
  
  // Content Security Policy
  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    img-src 'self' data: https:;
    font-src 'self';
    connect-src 'self';
    frame-ancestors 'none';
    base-uri 'self';
    form-action 'self';
  `.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim());
  
  // HSTS (only for production)
  if (event.url.protocol === 'https:') {
    response.headers.set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
  }
  
  return response;
}
```

### 3. Build Configuration Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** üü¢ Optimization Needed

While the build configuration removes console logs and debugger statements in production, source maps are disabled which could hinder debugging legitimate issues.

**Current Issues:**
- Source maps completely disabled (`sourcemap: false`)
- No integrity checks for external resources
- No subresource integrity (SRI) for CDN resources

**Remediation:**
Update `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
build: {
  // Enable source maps for production debugging but keep them external
  sourcemap: 'hidden', // or 'external' for separate files
  
  // Add rollup options for better security
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      // Add integrity attributes
      entryFileNames: '[name].[hash].js',
      chunkFileNames: '[name].[hash].js',
      assetFileNames: '[name].[hash].[ext]'
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. External Link Security (LOW PRIORITY)
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** üü¢ Good Practice Needed

External links in the FAQ component correctly use `rel="noopener"` but should also include `noreferrer` for complete protection.

**Current:** `rel="noopener"`  
**Recommended:** `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

**Remediation:**
Update all external links in `src/lib/components/FAQ.svelte`:

```svelte
<a href="https://external-site.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  External Link
  <ExternalLink size={14} />
</a>
```

### 5. Input Validation (INFORMATIONAL)
**Severity:** Informational  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Good

The application properly handles user input in the FAQ search functionality. Svelte's built-in XSS protection automatically escapes values, preventing injection attacks.

### 6. Authentication & Authorization (NOT APPLICABLE)
**Severity:** N/A  
**Status:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è Not Required

The application is a static informational website without user authentication, which reduces the attack surface significantly.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement Rate Limiting
For production deployment, implement rate limiting at the server/CDN level to prevent abuse:
- Limit requests per IP
- Implement CAPTCHA for forms (if added in future)

### 2. Regular Security Updates
- Set up automated dependency updates using Dependabot or Renovate
- Regularly run `npm audit` as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Subscribe to security advisories for used packages

### 3. Environment Variables
If environment variables are used in the future:
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `VITE_` prefix for client-exposed variables
- Keep sensitive data server-side only

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
Implement security monitoring:
- Log security-relevant events
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for failed security checks

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
Ensure HTTPS is enforced at all levels:
- Configure hosting provider to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Enable HSTS preloading
- Use secure cookies if implemented

## Action Priority Matrix

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| üî¥ HIGH | Update vulnerable dependencies | Low | High |
| üü° MEDIUM | Implement security headers | Low | High |
| üü¢ LOW | Fix external link attributes | Low | Low |
| üü¢ LOW | Enable source maps properly | Low | Medium |
| ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO | Set up dependency monitoring | Medium | Medium |

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance
- ‚úÖ No personal data collection
- ‚úÖ No cookies used
- ‚úÖ Privacy-focused design

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage
- ‚úÖ A01: Broken Access Control - N/A (no auth)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A02: Cryptographic Failures - Needs HTTPS enforcement
- ‚úÖ A03: Injection - Protected by Svelte
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A04: Insecure Design - Needs security headers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A05: Security Misconfiguration - Headers needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A06: Vulnerable Components - Updates needed
- ‚úÖ A07: Authentication Failures - N/A
- ‚úÖ A08: Software and Data Integrity - Build process secure
- ‚úÖ A09: Logging Failures - Consider adding
- ‚úÖ A10: SSRF - N/A (no server requests)

## Conclusion

The UseBCC website has a relatively good security posture for a static informational site. The main concerns are:

1. **Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities** - This is the most critical issue and should be addressed immediately
2. **Missing security headers** - Easy to implement and provides significant protection
3. **Minor configuration improvements** - Low priority but good for defense in depth

After implementing the recommended fixes, the application will have a strong security foundation appropriate for its use case.
